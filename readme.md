# Database Exporter

Export your database quickly and easily as a Laravel Migration and all the data as a Seeder class. This can be done via artisan commands or a controller action.

## Installation

Add `"nwidart/db-exporter"`* as a requirement to `composer.json`:

```php
{
    ...
    "require": {
        ...
		"nwidart/db-exporter": "0.6"
    },
}

```

Update composer:

```
$ php composer.phar update
```

Add the service provider to `app/config/app.php`:

```php
'Nwidart\DbExporter\DbExportHandlerServiceProvider'
```

(Optional) Publish the configuration file.

```
php artisan config:publish nwidart/db-exporter
```

**Use `dev-master` as version requirement to be on the cutting edge*


## Documentation

### From the commandline

#### Export database to migration

**Basic usage**

```
php artisan dbe:migrations
```

**Specify a database**

```
php artisan dbe:migrations otherDatabaseName
```

**Ignoring tables**

You can ignore multiple tables by seperating them with a comma.

```
php artisan dbe:migrations --ignore="table1,table2"
```

#### Export database table data to seed class
This command will export all your database table data into a seed class.

```
php artisan dbe:seeds
```
*Important: This **requires your database config file to be updated in `app/config/database.php`**.*


#### Uploading migrations/seeds to remote server
**!! Important** *This requires your app/config/remote.php to be configured. *

**!! Important** *The package configuration **remote** key needs to be configured to correspond to your remotes directory structure.*


You can with the following command, upload migrations and / or seeds to a remote host with `php artisan dbe:remote remoteName [--migrations] [--seeds]`

For instance **to upload the migrations to the production server:**

```
php artisan dbe:remote production --migrations
```
Or **upload the seeds to the production server:**

```
php artisan dbe:remote production --seeds
```
Or even combine the two:

```
php artisan dbe:remote production --migrations --seeds
```

***

### From a controller / route

#### Database to migration

##### Export current database

**This requires your database config file to be updated.** The class will export the database name from your `app/config/database.php` file, based on your 'default' option.


Make a export route on your development environment

```php

Route::get('export', function()
{
    DbExportHandler::migrate();
});
```

##### Export a custom database

```php

Route::get('export', function()
{
    DbExportHandler::migrate('otherDatabaseName');
});
```

#### Database to seed


This will write a seeder class with all the data of the current database.

```php

Route::get('exportSeed', function()
{
    DbExportHandler::seed();
});
```

Next all you have to do is add the call method on the base seed class:

```php

$this->call('nameOfYourSeedClass');

```

Now you can run from the commmand line:

* `php artisan db:seed`,
* or, without having to add the call method: `php artisan db:seed --class=nameOfYourSeedClass`

#### Chaining
You can also combine the generation of the migrations & the seed:

```php

DbExportHandler::migrate()->seed();

```
Or with:

```php

DbExportHandler::migrateAndSeed();

```
**!! Important :** Please note you cannot set a external seed database.
If you know of a way to connect to a external DB with laravel without writing in the app/database.php file [let me know](http://www.twitter.com/nicolaswidart).


#### Ignoring tables
By default the migrations table is ignored. You can add tabled to ignore with the following syntax:

```php

DbExportHandler::ignore('tableToIgnore')->migrate();
DbExportHandler::ignore('tableToIgnore')->seed();

```
You can also pass an array of tables to ignore.



## TODO
* ~~Export data too. It would be cool if it could also generate a seed file based of the data in the tables. This would be more usefull to run on the production server to get the seed on the development server.~~ **3/1/13**
* ~~Deploy the migration directly to the production server ready to be migrated. (as an option)~~ **5/1/13**
* ~~Make commands to do the same thing (export db to migration)~~ **4/1/13**
* ~~Make commands to do the same thing (export db to seed)~~ **4/1/13**
* Making the upload to remote available directly when generating the migrations/seeds




## Credits
Credits to **@michaeljcalkins** for the [original class](http://paste.laravel.com/1jdw#4) on paste.laravel.com (which goal was to generate migrations from a database). Sadly I couldn't get it working as-is, so I debugged it and decided to make a package out of it, and added a couple a features of my own.
